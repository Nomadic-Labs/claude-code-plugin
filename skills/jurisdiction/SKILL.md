# Jurisdiction Scoring

The user provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as: `[country]` or comparative queries like `[country] vs [country]`
- Country name is case-insensitive. Match against the `name` field in `countries` array.
- If the user provides multiple countries (e.g. "Paraguay vs Panama"), show both side-by-side.

## Step 1: Read the data

Read the file at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data/jurisdiction-scoring.json`.
Top-level key is `countries` (array). Each item has:
- `name` — country name
- `region` — geographic region
- `tier` — crypto-tax tier (context: HEAVEN = best tax environment)
- `summary` — 1-2 sentence country overview
- `details.safetyScore` — 1-10 (10 = safest)
- `details.healthcareScore` — 1-10
- `details.institutionalScore` — 1-10 (rule of law, stability)
- `details.businessEaseScore` — 1-10 (ease of doing business)
- `details.internationalSchooling` — 1-10
- `details.privacyScore` — 1-10 (financial/data privacy)
- `details.qualityOfLife` — "Low" / "Medium" / "High"
- `details.bankingAccess` — "Limited" / "Moderate" / "Good" / "Excellent"
- `details.dualNationalityAllowed` — boolean
- `details.pathToCitizenship` — text description
- `details.bitizenshipAvailable` — boolean (citizenship by investment)
- `details.costOfLiving` — "Low" / "Medium" / "High"
- `capitalGainsTax`, `incomeTaxOnCrypto`, `corporateTax` — tax rates

## Step 2: Score bar helper

Represent each score as a visual bar:
- 1-3: 🔴 (Low)
- 4-6: 🟡 (Medium)
- 7-8: 🟢 (Good)
- 9-10: ✅ (Excellent)

Format: `[emoji] [score]/10`

## Step 3: Single Country Format

## Step 4: Two Countries Side-by-Side

If the user asked about 2 countries (e.g. "Paraguay vs Panama"):

| Category | [country1] | [country2] |
|---|---|---|
| 🛡️ Safety | [score/10] | [score/10] |
| 🏥 Healthcare | [score/10] | [score/10] |
| ⚖️ Institutions | [score/10] | [score/10] |
| 💼 Business Ease | [score/10] | [score/10] |
| 🔒 Privacy | [score/10] | [score/10] |
| 💰 Crypto Tax Tier | [tier] | [tier] |
| 🏦 Banking | [bankingAccess] | [bankingAccess] |
| 🌍 Dual Nationality | [Yes/No] | [Yes/No] |
| 💎 CBI | [Yes/No] | [Yes/No] |

Then give a **1-paragraph recommendation** based on the scores.
